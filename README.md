web2py_devenv
=============

**web2py_devenv** is a tool to help you create a professional [Web2py](http://web2py.com) development environment to run inside Virtualenv or Vagrant.

By default, Web2py gives you a scaffolding application, called Welcome. It's a really good starting point and you can go further with web2py_devenv, using your own custom scaffolding application. All you need is configure it and publish it as a zip file, a git repository or a simple directory in your computer.

You can use your own .gitignore, too. We have a default one that works nice with Web2py, to avoid copying or creating a new one every time you start a new project.

We automate all this configuration process and initialize a git repo for you, with a suggested directory structure.

**Note:** currently, these configuration options are not in Virtualenv version, yet.

**To-do list:** See issues page.
