web2py_devenv
=============

web2py_devenv is a tool to help you create a professional Web2py development environment using Virtualenv or Vagrant.

By default, Web2py gives you a scaffolding application, called Welcome. It's a really good starting point and you can go further with web2py_devenv, using your own custom scaffolding application.

All you need is configure it and publish it as a zip file, a git repository or a simple directory in your computer.

As we use git, we have a default .gitignore file, but you can use your own, too.
